# Prolog_KUL
This repo groups together a series of programs I started developing during the Programming Languages and Methodologies course, taken as part of my Advanced Master's in AI at KU Leuven. This groups exercices in a SWish prolog notebook and prolog programs as part of exam preparations.

Among others, some key concepts I have explored here are:

- Accumulators
- Binary trees
- Constraint logic programming (CLP)
- Definite clause grammar (DCG)
- Declarative and procedural meanings in Prolog
- Difference lists
- Failure-driven loops
- General prolog syntax
- Generate-and-test patterns
- Heuristic functions
- List manipulation
- Reification (conversion of value tests into booleans)
